# Bucket Lister

Bucket Lister is a Full-stack, full CRUD single-page web application created using React, JavaScript, Express.js, and MongoDB, and deployed on Heroku. I created this app with the intention of empowering people to track their wildest ideas/desired activities throughout their life. Users can come back to their lists to add and edit items, and even check off done items. As a lover of organization, I feel that having a designated space to document your ideas for activities, trips, and more can inspire you to actually do them instead of letting them get lost in the limbo of life. There is also a feature that enables users to generate a list of 5 (at a time) random bucket list ideas from a third-party API to get their creative juices flowing. I hope you enjoy!

Here is the landing page for visitors, complete with the option to toggle to a log in or sign up form depending on whether the visitor has an account or not.

Once signed up or logged in, users are directed to the 'About Page' where they can read a little bit about the application.

Users can use the navigation on the right to head to the 'Your List Page,' which shows all of the user's current bucket list items that they have either manually added using the form or added from the suggestions using the + button.

When the user clicks on any of their bucket list items on the page above, they are brought to a detail page for the item they clicked, where they can choose to enter more specifics about that list item.

When the user clicks the white checkbox to the left of any of their list items on their 'Your List Page,' the item they clicked on will automatically be moved to the 'Done Page,' where it will render with a read-only checkbox with the checked property equal to true. From the 'Done List Page,' users can still click on their done list items and navigate to the details page for that item to edit or delete the item if they wish.
