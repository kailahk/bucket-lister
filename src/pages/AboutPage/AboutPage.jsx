            with the intention of empowering people to write down their wildest ideas and desired activities (no matter how big or small).
            Users can come back to their lists to add and edit items, and even check off done items. As a lover of organization, the creator 
            of this app feels that having a designated space to document your ideas for activities, trips, and more can inspire you to actually 
            do them instead of letting them get lost in the limbo of life. There is also a feature that enables users to generate a list of 5 
            (at a time) random bucket list ideas to get their creative juices flowing. We hope you enjoy!

            P.S. don't forget to get off the computer and actually do stuff!</p>
